# Yet another Dolores clone

This is a Discord Bot for Pixel Starships, targeted for hosting on Heroku.

## Using the bot on your Discord server

If all you want is using the bot on your Discord server, then the following link will redirect you to a page where you can invite the canonical bot instance to your server: <http://bit.ly/invite-pss-statistics>.

Once you have added the bot, just type this command inside Discord chat to get the list of supported commands:

    /help

Every once in a while the canonical bot instance will be updated with bugfixes and feature enhancements. This command will show the bot's current version:

    /about

## Developing with your own bot instance

If you want to do software development with your own bot instance, then you can find information on how to get started in the [bootstrap.md](bootstrap.md) document.
