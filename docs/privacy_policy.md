# Privacy Policy for Dolores 2.0

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how **Dolores 2.0** (hereinafter referred to as "the Bot", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects information when you use our Discord bot service. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

This Privacy Policy applies to the hosted instance of Dolores 2.0. If you self-host the Bot using the open source code available under the MIT License, you are responsible for your own data collection and privacy practices in compliance with applicable laws.

**Important:** We take your privacy seriously and have designed the Bot to minimize data collection. Currently, we do not persistently store any personal information.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us using the information provided in Section 11.

## 2. Data Controller

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, and Switzerland, the data controller is:

**Tim Zech**  
**Location:** Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany  
**Contact:** theworstpss@gmail.com

## 3. Information We Collect

### 3.1 Data Collected from Discord

When you use the Bot, we temporarily process the following information provided by Discord's API to enable the Bot's functionality:

**User Information:**
- Discord User ID
- Discord Username
- Discord Discriminator (if applicable)
- User roles and permissions within the server

**Server Information:**
- Discord Server (Guild) ID
- Server name
- Channel IDs and names where the Bot is used
- Server roles and permissions

**Interaction Data:**
- Commands you execute
- Messages the Bot responds to
- Interaction timestamps
- Bot command parameters and arguments

**Message Content:**
The Bot may temporarily access message content as necessary to provide its functionality. This access is limited to messages in channels where the Bot has appropriate permissions and is used in accordance with Discord's Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy.

### 3.2 Data We DO NOT Collect

We explicitly **do not** collect or have access to:
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Payment information
- IP addresses
- Browser information
- Device information
- Your actual Discord password or authentication tokens

### 3.3 Third-Party Game Data (Pixel Starships)

**Important Disclosure:** The Bot accesses data from a separate application called **PSS Fleet Data**, which collects and stores information from the game Pixel Starships. This data includes:

- Pixel Starships player IDs
- Pixel Starships player names (in-game names)
- Player statistics and game-related information
- Fleet and alliance data

**Key Points:**
- This data is collected from the Pixel Starships game, not from Discord
- PSS Fleet Data is a separate application with its own database
- There is **no linking** between Discord user information and Pixel Starships data
- The Bot only retrieves and displays this publicly available game data
- We do not create associations between your Discord identity and your Pixel Starships identity

When you use commands that display Pixel Starships information, the Bot queries the PSS Fleet Data database and presents the results in Discord. Your Discord identity remains separate from any game data.

## 4. How We Use Your Information

### 4.1 Current Use (Non-Persistent Data)

Currently, all data processing occurs **in memory only** and is **not persistently stored**. We use the temporarily processed information solely for the following purposes:

**Service Delivery:**
- To execute commands you request
- To respond to your interactions with the Bot
- To display information from Pixel Starships via PSS Fleet Data
- To provide Bot features and functionality

**Access Control:**
- To verify permissions and roles
- To enforce server-specific Bot configurations
- To ensure proper authorization for Bot commands

**Bot Operations:**
- To process and respond to commands in real-time
- To maintain Bot functionality during active sessions
- To route responses to the correct channels and users

**Important:** Once a command is processed or the Bot is restarted, all temporarily processed Discord data is automatically cleared from memory. We do not write Discord user data to disk, databases, or any persistent storage medium.

### 4.2 Future Use (Potential Persistent Storage)

**Please Note:** In the future premium features and subscriptions may be added. When this occurs, we will need to persistently store some user information to manage subscriptions and premium access.

**Before implementing persistent data storage, we will:**
1. Update this Privacy Policy with specific details about what data will be stored
2. Notify all users through Discord announcements and Bot notifications
3. Provide clear opt-in mechanisms for premium features
4. Offer data access, correction, and deletion rights as required by law
5. Implement appropriate security measures for stored data

**Expected future data storage may include:**
- Discord User IDs (to identify premium subscribers)
- Subscription status and tier information
- Purchase/transaction records (as required by law)
- Premium feature usage data
- User preferences and settings

We will not implement persistent storage of personal data until we provide updated notice and comply with all applicable privacy laws, including GDPR.

## 5. Data Retention

### 5.1 Current Retention (Ephemeral Data)

**Temporary/In-Memory Data:** All Discord data processed by the Bot is held in memory only while the Bot is running and only for as long as necessary to process your commands. This data is automatically deleted when:
- The command processing is complete
- The Bot is restarted
- The Bot is shut down
- Memory is cleared during normal operations

**Retention Period:** Seconds to minutes, depending on command execution time.

### 5.2 PSS Fleet Data Retention

Data stored in the PSS Fleet Data database (separate from the Bot) is retained according to that application's own data retention policies. The Bot does not control or manage this data retention. PSS Fleet Data collects publicly available game information from Pixel Starships.

### 5.3 Future Retention

When we implement persistent storage for premium features, we will specify exact retention periods in an updated Privacy Policy. Data will only be retained as long as necessary to provide services or as required by law.

## 6. Data Sharing and Disclosure

### 6.1 Third-Party Sharing

We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties.

**Current third-party interactions include:**

**Discord API:** We interact with Discord's API to provide Bot functionality. This interaction is governed by Discord's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

**PSS Fleet Data:** The Bot queries the PSS Fleet Data application to retrieve Pixel Starships game information. This is a separate application, and no Discord user data is transmitted to PSS Fleet Data.

### 6.2 Legal Disclosure

We may disclose information if required to do so by law or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to:
- Comply with legal obligations, court orders, or legal processes
- Protect and defend our rights or property
- Protect the personal safety of users or the public
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Bot
- Comply with Discord's Terms of Service or Developer Policy

### 6.3 Business Transfers

In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, user information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify users of any such change and provide choices regarding their information.

### 6.4 Open Source Code

The Bot's source code is available on GitHub under the MIT License. However, the open source code does not include any user data, API keys, or operational configurations. Self-hosting the code does not grant access to data from our hosted Bot instance.

## 7. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information processed by the Bot from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

**Current security measures include:**
- Secure API token storage and handling
- Access controls and authentication for Bot infrastructure
- Regular security updates and patches
- Encrypted connections (TLS/SSL) for all Discord API communications
- Limited access to Bot hosting infrastructure
- Compliance with Discord's security requirements

**Limitations:**
- No data transmission or storage system is 100% secure
- Discord controls the security of data within Discord's platform
- We cannot guarantee absolute security

**Your Responsibility:**
- Keep your Discord account credentials secure
- Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication on Discord
- Be cautious about what information you share in Discord servers
- Understand that server administrators have access to your Discord activity in their servers

When we implement persistent data storage in the future, we will implement additional security measures appropriate for stored personal data, including encryption at rest, regular backups, and access logging.

## 8. Your Rights (GDPR and Privacy Laws)

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information under privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and others.

### 8.1 Current Rights (Non-Persistent Data)

- Remove the Bot from your Discord server (if you are a server administrator)
- Leave servers where the Bot is present
- Block the Bot user on Discord

## 9. Children's Privacy

The Bot is provided through Discord, which requires users to be at least 13 years of age (or older in some jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age required by Discord's Terms of Service.

If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under the applicable age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.

If you believe we have collected information from a child improperly, please contact us immediately.

## 10. International Data Transfers

The Bot is operated from Germany. If you access the Bot from outside the European Economic Area (EEA), your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in Germany or other locations where our service providers operate.

By using the Bot, you consent to the transfer of your information to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have different data protection rules than your country.

When we implement persistent data storage, we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for international data transfers in compliance with GDPR and other applicable laws, such as:
- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
- Adequacy decisions by the European Commission
- Other legally recognized transfer mechanisms

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or other factors.

**When we make material changes, we will:**
- Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document
- Notify users through Discord announcements, direct messages, or Bot notifications
- Provide a reasonable notice period before changes take effect
- Obtain consent if required by applicable law

**Especially Important:** Before implementing persistent data storage for premium features, we will provide advance notice and an updated Privacy Policy with specific details about data collection, storage, use, and your rights.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Bot after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
