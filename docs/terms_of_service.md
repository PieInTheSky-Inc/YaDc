# Terms of Service for Dolores 2.0

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025

## 1. Agreement to Terms

By inviting the Discord bot **Dolores 2.0** (hereinafter referred to as "the Bot" or "the Service") to your Discord server, using its features, or interacting with it in any way, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"), the accompanying Privacy Policy, and all applicable policies referenced herein.

You must have the appropriate permissions to add the Bot to a Discord server. Continued use of the Bot implies your acceptance of these Terms.

If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must immediately discontinue use of the Bot and remove it from your server(s).

## 2. Compliance with Discord Policies

By using the Bot, you agree to comply with:

- Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)
- Discord's [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)
- Discord's [Developer Terms of Service](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8562894815383)
- Discord's [Developer Policy](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8563934450327)
- All other applicable Discord policies and guidelines

You are strictly prohibited from using the Bot in any manner that violates Discord's Terms of Service or for any illegal purposes.

## 3. Age Requirements

Use of the Bot is permitted only for individuals who meet Discord's minimum age requirements as outlined in Discord's Terms of Service. You must be at least 13 years of age (or older, depending on your jurisdiction) to use Discord and, by extension, this Bot.

## 4. Dual Licensing: Open Source Code vs. Hosted Service

### 4.1 Open Source Code License

The source code for Dolores 2.0 is available on GitHub under the **MIT License**. The MIT License grants you extensive rights to use, modify, and distribute the source code, subject to the terms of that license. You can find the full MIT License text in the source code repository.

**If you self-host the Bot using your own infrastructure:**
- Your use of the source code is governed **solely by the MIT License**
- These Terms of Service **do not apply** to self-hosted instances
- You are free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, subject to the MIT License requirements
- You must include the copyright notice and MIT License text in all copies or substantial portions of the software
- The software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, as stated in the MIT License

### 4.2 Hosted Service Terms

These Terms of Service apply **only** when you use the hosted instance of Dolores 2.0 (the Bot that you invite to your server without self-hosting). The hosted service is the Bot instance operated and maintained by us.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Source Code** (on GitHub): MIT Licensed - you can do almost anything with it
- **Hosted Service** (the bot you invite): Governed by these Terms of Service

By using the hosted Bot service, you receive the convenience of a maintained, hosted solution, but you agree to these additional terms governing the service delivery.

### 4.3 Usage Rights for Hosted Service

When using the hosted Bot service, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Bot for personal or non-commercial purposes on Discord servers where you have appropriate permissions.

When using the **hosted service**, you may not:
- Use the Bot for any commercial purposes without express written consent
- Use the Bot in any way that violates applicable laws, rules, or regulations
- Use the Bot to harass, abuse, threaten, or impersonate others
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Bot's systems or infrastructure
- Use the Bot to distribute spam, malware, or other harmful content
- Exploit bugs or vulnerabilities for personal gain or to harm others
- Attempt to reverse engineer or extract the operational details of the hosted service infrastructure

**Note:** The restrictions above apply to the **hosted service only**. If you self-host using the open source code, you are bound only by the MIT License terms.

## 5. User Responsibilities

As a user or server administrator who has added the hosted Bot, you are responsible for:

- Ensuring that all users in your server are aware of and comply with these Terms
- Maintaining the security of your Discord account and server
- All activities that occur through your use of the hosted Bot service
- Informing server members about the Bot's presence and data access capabilities
- Complying with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations

## 6. Bot Functionality and Availability

### 6.1 Service Availability

The hosted Bot service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not guarantee that:
- The Bot will be available at all times without interruption
- The Bot will be error-free or free from bugs
- Any errors or defects will be corrected
- The Bot will meet your specific requirements

**Self-hosting alternative:** If uptime and availability are critical to your needs, you may choose to self-host the Bot using the open source code under the MIT License.

### 6.2 Modifications and Updates

We reserve the right to:
- Modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the hosted Bot service at any time without prior notice
- Update these Terms from time to time
- Remove the Bot from servers that violate these Terms or Discord's policies

### 6.3 No Warranty

The hosted Bot service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

**Note:** The MIT License also provides the source code "as is" without warranty. This is consistent across both the open source code and the hosted service.

## 7. Data Collection and Privacy

The hosted Bot service may collect and process certain user data to provide its functionality. For detailed information about what data is collected, how it is used, stored, and protected, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

By using the hosted Bot service, you acknowledge and agree to the data collection and processing practices described in the Privacy Policy.

**Self-hosting:** If you self-host the Bot, you are the data controller and are responsible for your own data collection and privacy practices in compliance with applicable laws (including GDPR if applicable).

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we (the Bot owner, developers, and contributors) shall not be liable for any:

- Indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages
- Loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill
- Service interruptions or unavailability
- Damages resulting from your use or inability to use the hosted Bot service
- Unauthorized access to or alteration of your data
- Conduct or content of any third party using the Bot
- Any other matter relating to the hosted Bot service

Our total liability to you for any claims arising from or related to these Terms or your use of the hosted Bot service shall not exceed â‚¬100 (one hundred euros) or the equivalent amount in your local currency.

**Note:** The MIT License also includes similar limitation of liability provisions for use of the source code.

## 9. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Bot owner, developers, contributors, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from:

- Your use or misuse of the hosted Bot service
- Your violation of these Terms
- Your violation of any rights of another party
- Your violation of any applicable laws or regulations

## 10. Intellectual Property

### 10.1 Source Code

The source code for Dolores 2.0 is licensed under the MIT License and is available on GitHub. You have the rights granted by the MIT License to use, modify, and distribute the source code, subject to the requirements of that license (primarily: inclusion of copyright notice and license text).

### 10.2 Trademarks and Branding

While the source code is MIT Licensed, the name "Dolores 2.0", logos, and branding materials (if any) remain the property of the Bot owner. You may not use the Bot's name, logo, or branding in a way that suggests endorsement without express written permission, even when self-hosting modified versions of the code.

### 10.3 Service Infrastructure

The infrastructure, operational configurations, and service delivery mechanisms for the hosted Bot service remain proprietary and are not covered by the MIT License.

## 11. Termination

### 11.1 Termination by You

You may terminate your use of the hosted Bot service at any time by removing it from your Discord server(s).

### 11.2 Termination by Us

We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to the hosted Bot service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including but not limited to:
- Violation of these Terms
- Violation of Discord's Terms of Service or policies
- Engaging in illegal activities
- Abusive or harmful behavior
- Technical or security reasons

### 11.3 Effect of Termination

Upon termination, your right to use the hosted Bot service will immediately cease. Provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including but not limited to intellectual property provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnification, and limitations of liability.

**Self-hosting rights:** Termination of your access to the hosted service does not affect your rights under the MIT License to use the open source code for self-hosting.

## 12. Prohibited Conduct

You may not use the hosted Bot service to:

- Violate any applicable laws, regulations, or third-party rights
- Engage in or promote illegal activities
- Harass, abuse, threaten, or intimidate others
- Distribute spam, advertisements, or unsolicited messages
- Share or distribute malicious software or harmful content
- Impersonate others or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity
- Interfere with or disrupt the Bot's operation or Discord's services
- Attempt to bypass any security measures or access restrictions
- Collect or harvest data from other users without their consent
- Use automated systems to interact with the Bot in ways that abuse or strain its systems

## 13. Changes to Terms

We may modify these Terms at any time. When we make material changes, we will notify users through appropriate channels (such as Discord announcements or direct messages). Your continued use of the hosted Bot service after such modifications constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.

It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this document indicates when these Terms were last revised.

## 14. Relationship to MIT License

These Terms of Service govern the hosted Bot service only. To the extent there is any conflict between these Terms and the MIT License regarding the source code, the MIT License governs your use of the source code itself. These Terms do not restrict your rights under the MIT License to use, modify, and distribute the source code.

## 15. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

## 16. Governing Law and Disputes

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the hosted Bot service shall be resolved through good faith negotiations. If negotiations fail, disputes shall be resolved in the competent courts of Potsdam, Germany.

## 17. Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other policies referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the hosted Bot service and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral.

## 18. No Waiver

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by us.

## 19. Open Source Acknowledgment

This project is built on open source principles. We encourage users who want more control, customization, or who wish to contribute improvements to explore the source code on GitHub. Contributions to the open source project are welcome and governed by the MIT License and any contributor agreements in the repository.
